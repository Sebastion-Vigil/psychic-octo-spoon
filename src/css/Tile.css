.tile {
  height: 8.5%;
  width: 10.5%;
  border: .5px solid silver;
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
}

/* 
gonna change ^^ leaving commented for now 
for future reference

so we gotta lotta tiles here
24 all in all
each with a unique background image
we gotta do this programmatically
(this program doesn't like spaghetti)
so I need to store all 24 image urls somewhere
for later access by a function which will
generate 24 of these tiles, each with their
own unique image id AND unique x/y coordinates,
since there position is absolute and they will
need to be moved.

...hmmm...methinks this function will need 
Satan's Little Helper...

...eyes open never shut again...
